# PowerFM
PowerFM is an open-source repository for foundation models in the power and energy domain. It hosts and collects fine-tuned and domain-trained models for tasks like load forecasting, fault detection, grid simulation, and agent control.

## 🚀 Getting Started with PowerFM

### RAG-based Foundation Models

#### [Explore the Datacenter Siting Assistant: Solvtra](https://huggingface.co/spaces/zhangqianleo/datacenterAgent)

**Datacenter Siting Assistant: Solvtra** is a tool leverages RAG by incorporating datacenter-specific data, including local regulations, environmental reports, and infrastructure details. As a result, it can provide detailed information for potential datacenter locations, such as land and electricity prices, and generate a map illustrating existing datacenter sites and relevant infrastructure.
