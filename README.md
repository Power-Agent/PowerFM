# PowerFM
PowerFM is an open-source repository for foundation models in the power and energy domain. It both maintains original projects and collects community-contributed open-source projects, featuring fine-tuned and domain-trained models for tasks like load forecasting, fault detection, grid simulation, and agent control.


## 🚀 Getting Started with PowerFM


### OpenPowerBench: Transformer-based Foundation Models

#### [Explore the Dataset and Benchmark for Power System Foundation Models Across Multiple Scales and Topologies](https://github.com/OpenPowerBench/OpenPowerBench)

**OpenPowerBench** is a first-of-its-kind open-source, multi-task, cross-temporal dataset designed to support training and evaluation of foundation models in power systems. OpenPowerBench includes both topology-dependent tasks (e.g., power flow, optimal power flow, contingency analysis) and topology-independent tasks (e.g., load forecasting, price prediction), supported by a modular data generation pipeline for scalable benchmarking across synthetic and real-world scenarios.

### GridFM: Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based Foundation Models

#### [Explore the Dataset and Graph for GridFM](https://github.com/gridfm)

**GridFM Community** The GridFM project pioneers the concept of FMs for the electric power grid to be trained on grid data – as opposed to text data – with the overarching goal to develop the underlying technology to cope with the increasing complexity and uncertainties of a faster growing grid (e.g., due to hyperscalar data centers, crypto mining etc.). More information about GridFM Community can be found [here](https://gridfm.org/)

### RAG-based Foundation Models

#### [Explore the Datacenter Siting Assistant: Solvtra](https://huggingface.co/spaces/zhangqianleo/datacenterAgent)

**Datacenter Siting Assistant: Solvtra** is a tool leverages RAG by incorporating datacenter-specific data, including local regulations, environmental reports, and infrastructure details. As a result, it can provide detailed information for potential datacenter locations, such as land and electricity prices, and generate a map illustrating existing datacenter sites and relevant infrastructure.
